00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What is the softest thing in the universe?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And we all know that is the hands and voices of the elderly.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So...

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I thought if I just, like, pop these on,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
these elderly people's hands, though.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yeah.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They fit like a glove.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I mean, that's perfect, innit?

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah.

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So I thought...

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's like...

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you just enjoy the...

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we play the cassette...

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yeah, you ready...

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Of a softly-spoken elderly lady...

16
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here is the elderly lady talking now.

17
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Hello, Greg.

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You're such a wonderful person.

19
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're all so proud of you.

20
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Such a big, strong, beefy boy.
